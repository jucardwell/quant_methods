# Course Competencies

### Concept 1: The Quantitative Revolution

**Guiding Question**: Why did geography become a quantitative discipline, and how did it change how we study space?

-   Describe the origins of the Quantitative Revolution in geography and how political and academic pressures pushed geography towards a “spatial science” 
-   Identify assumptions built into quantitative reasoning (measurability, objectivity, universality)
-   Reflect on critiques and limits of the revolution from human and critical geographers
-   Interpret early spatial models (e.g., gravity model, rank-size rule)

### Concept 2: The Problem of Spatial Data

**Guiding Question**: Why is spatial data different, and how does it challenge traditional statistics?

-   Explain how spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, and distance decay influence the structure and interpretation of spatial data
-   Evaluate issues of scale, zoning, and aggregation (MAUP)
-   Connect the “spatial problem” to violations of independence in classical inference

### Concept 3: Descriptive Statistics and Spatial Description

**Guiding Question:** How do we summarize and describe variation in geographic data?

-   Classify different types of geographic data and variables (e.g., primary vs. secondary, individual vs. aggregated, qualitative vs. quantitative, level of measurement), and explain how these distinctions influence analysis
-   Explain and evaluate measurement quality in geographic data, including precision, accuracy, validity, and reliability.
-   Summarize and interpret attribute data using descriptive statistics (central tendency, dispersion, shape) and data visualizations
-   Use maps to visually analyze spatial patterns
-   Compute and interpret spatial descriptive statistics (mean center, standard distance, standard deviational ellipse) and explain how they extend non-spatial descriptive measures.
-   Identify unusual values, skewed distributions, and outliers in attributes and geographic space, and explain their analytical implications.
