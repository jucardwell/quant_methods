-   **Mastery:** Completes Case Study #1 with Meets Expectations or a 15 minute oral exam (in office hours)

### Concept 1: The Quantitative Revolution

**Guiding Question**: Why did geography become a quantitative discipline, and how did it change how we study space?

-   Describe the origins of the Quantitative Revolution in geography and how political and academic pressures pushed geography towards a “spatial science” 
-   Identify assumptions built into quantitative reasoning (measurability, objectivity, universality)
-   Reflect on critiques and limits of the Quantitative Revolution from human and critical geographers
-   Interpret early spatial models
-   Explain how MAUP, spatial dependence, spatial heterogeneity, and distance decay influence the structure and interpretation of spatial data
-   Connect the “spatial problem” to violations of independence in classical inference

### Concept 2: Data and Descriptive Statistics

**Guiding Question:** How do we summarize and describe variation in data?

-   Classify different types of geographic data and variables (e.g., primary vs. secondary, individual vs. aggregated, qualitative vs. quantitative, level of measurement), and explain how these distinctions influence analysis
-   Explain and evaluate measurement quality in geographic data, including precision, accuracy, validity, and reliability.
-   Summarize and interpret attribute data using descriptive statistics (central tendency, dispersion, shape) and data visualizations

### Concept 3: Spatial Description

**Guiding Question:** How do we summarize and describe variation in geographic data?

-   Use maps to visually analyze spatial patterns and understand the role of classification schemes for grouping spatial data values

-   Compute and interpret spatial descriptive statistics (mean center, standard distance, standard deviational ellipse) and explain how they extend non-spatial descriptive measures

## Tier 2: Inferential Statistics

### Assessment Structure:

-   **Competency:** Completes Lab 4-6 with Meets Expectations
-   **Mastery:** Completes Case Study #2 with Meets Expectations or a 15 minute oral exam (in office hours)

### **Concept 4: Probability**

**Guiding Question**: How can we use probability to quantify uncertainty and understand patterns in events?

-   Compute and interpret simple event (empirical) probabilities
-   Compute and interpret probabilities for discrete and continuous data using theoretical probability distributions
-   Visualize probability across space

### **Concept 5: Inferential Statistics**

**Guiding Question**: How can we use sample data to understand and estimate characteristics of a population?

-   Explain the Central Limit Theorem and why it allows us to generalize from samples to populations.
-   Identify how sampling design affects representativeness and uncertainty (simple, systematic, stratified, cluster, spatial hybrid).
-   Estimate and interpret population parameters (means and proportions) from samples (calculate point estimates and confidence intervals)

### **Concept 6: Hypothesis Testing**

**Guiding Question:** How can we generate and test hypotheses about a population using sample data?

-   Distinguish between the null (H₀) and alternative (H₁) hypotheses
-   Identify the two types of error in hypothesis testing (Type I and Type II)
-   Formulate testable hypotheses and identify an appropriate statistical test based on the characteristics of the data 
-   Run and interpret one sample and two sample t-tests to compare means between one or two groups
-   Run and interpret Chi-Square tests to assess relationships between categorical variables
-   Differentiate statistical significance from substantive importance

## Tier 3: Spatial Patterns and Surfaces

### Assessment Structure:

-   **Competency:** Completes Lab 7-9 with Meets Expectations
-   **Mastery:** Completes Case Study #3 with Meets Expectations or a 15 minute oral exam (in office hours)

### **Concept 7: Patterns in Events**

**Guiding Question:** How can we assess the distribution/pattern of individual events in space?

-   Distinguish random, clustered, and regular event patterns
-   Compute and interpret quadrat tests to assess spatial randomness (CSR) and determine statistical significance
-   Compute and interpret nearest neighbor statistics to assess spatial randomness and determine statistical significance
-   Visualize event patterns using point maps and density surfaces (kernel density estimation)
-   Evaluate the effects of scale and edge boundaries on event pattern analysis

### **Concept 8: Patterns in Values**

**Guiding Question:** How can we detect patterns in attribute values across points or areas?

-   Define spatial influence (neighborhoods) for point and aerial data using KNN, Queens Case, and distance-based measures
-   Compute and interpret measures of global autocorrelation (Moran’s I)
-   Compute and interpret measures of local autocorrelation (LISA) and use mapping to identify and analyze spatial patterns (hot-spots, cold-spots)
-   Discuss how scale, zoning, and MAUP influence patterns

### **Concept 9: Spatially Continuous Surfaces**

**Guiding Question:** How can we estimate values at unsampled locations and understand spatial clustering and uncertainty across continuous surfaces?

-   Compute point estimates at unsampled locations using Thiessen polygons, IDW, and k-point means.
-   Define and interpret the semivariogram to understand spatial clustering, correlation, and range of influence.
-   Approximate uncertainty for predictions using sample variance or semivariogram-based approaches and interpret the implications.
