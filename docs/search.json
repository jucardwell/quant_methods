Because of this, while I don’t expect you to be able to generate code independently, I do expect you to develop a competency in navigating the RStudio environment and modifying code that I give you to complete specific tasks. This chapter will introduce you to R and RStudio.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for working with R code. R is an open-source programming language that has excellent capabilities for analyzing and visualizing spatial data.\nTo use R and RStudio, you will need to download and install both programs on your computer.\nOnce you have downloaded and installed RStudio, open up the application. We need to change one global setting before we start. You only need to do this once!

Each .Rmd starts with a header, where you can change the name and the date.\nA .Rmd is made up of two main components: code chunks (this is where you write code) and text (any words that are outside of a code chunk). Any time you are writing code, it needs to be in a code chunk. Chunks can then be run to execute the code within the chunk. The idea of chunking is to group code that accomplishes a single, related task into one code chunk. When you begin a new step or process in your workflow, you start a new chunk.\nYour .Rmd template already has a header (where you can change the name and date) and two code chunks. The first code chunk is the SET UP CHUNK. The second code chunk is the LIBRARY AND DATA CHUNK. To load the libraries and data, you should RUN CODE CHUNK.\n\nIf everything is working, ‘parks’ should appear in your environment. The ‘parks’ dataset is now an “object”.\nWe can view objects by double clicking the object in the environment. A data table should appear with all the information about the parks.\n\nAdd a new code chunk and add the code below to create your first map. Every command that you create should have a comment (#) above that explains what that command is doing. If you run that chunk, a map should appear below.",

    "text": "5.1 Orienting Ourselves to the Datasets\nIn this chapter, we will apply what we know about describing data to explore three datasets. Descriptive statistics are a set of tools that allow us to summarize a given dataset based on various characteristics.\nWe will use the following spatial data:\nThe last two datasets are aggregated summaries rather than raw measurements. The Climate Normals are temporal averages,meaning that the data represent the average conditions over a 30-year period. The ACS data are spatial averages, which summarize individual responses within defined geographic areas. This is a requirement for many spatial datasets, even when individual-level data is available, to maintain anonymity.\nAs a result, when we analyze these datasets, we are working with information that has already been statistically summarized over time and space, and our own statistical descriptions will be second-order summaries that describe patterns in data that have already been aggregated.\nTo follow along with this tutorial, download the .Rmd template here. The template already includes a code chunk for loading libraries and reading in the data, along with labeled empty chunks for each section of the tutorial. As you work through the code examples below, add each set of commands to the chunk with the matching section heading in your template.\nThe ‘glimpse()’ function provides a quick overview of the structure and contents of a dataset. It displays the data types of each column and a preview of the data, making it easier to understand the dataset at a glance.\n## glimpse at the rurality data\nglimpse(rurality)\n\nRows: 2,672\nColumns: 4\n$ GEOID           &lt;chr&gt;

    "text": "6.1 Loading Libraries and Reading in Data\nIn this chapter, we will build on the descriptive tools we learned in the Describing Data chapter. Spatial descriptive statistics summarize spatial patterns, not just patterns in value.\nWe will use the following spatial data:\nTo follow along with this tutorial, save this data into your “data” subfolder in your “describing data” folder. Create and dave a new .Rmd called “describing_spatial_data.Rmd” in your “desciribing data folder”. Whenever you see lines of code, copy them into your own .Rmd.\nNorth Carolina census tract rurality definitions (RUCA codes) from the USDA Economic Research Service and North Carolina Rural Center. These two sources offer differing definitions of rurality. RUCA codes establish urban cores and the census tracts that are the most economically integrated with those cores through commuting. The North Carolina Rural Center defines rurality by a population density threshold (rural &lt; 250 people per square mile).\nThe last two datasets are aggregated summaries rather than raw measurements. The Climate Normals are temporal averages,meaning that the data represent the average conditions over a 30-year period. The ACS data are spatial averages, which summarize individual responses within defined geographic areas. This is a requirement for many spatial datasets, even when individual-level data is available, to maintain anonymity.\nAs a result, when we analyze these datasets, we are working with information that has already been statistically summarized over time and space, and our own statistical descriptions will be second-order summaries that describe patterns in data that have already been aggregated.\nTo follow along with this tutorial, create a folder called “describing_data” and a subfolder called “data”. Save the data into the “data” subfolder, and create and save a .Rmd called “describing_data.Rmd” in the “describing_data” folder.
