Because of this, while I don’t expect you to be able to generate code independently, I do expect you to develop a competency in navigating the RStudio environment and modifying code that I give you to complete specific tasks. This chapter will introduce you to R and RStudio.\nRStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R. RStudio provides a user-friendly interface for working with R code. R is an open-source programming language that has excellent capabilities for analyzing and visualizing spatial data.\nTo use R and RStudio, you will need to download and install both programs on your computer.\nOnce you have downloaded and installed RStudio, open up the application. We need to change one global setting before we start. You only need to do this once! Navigate Tools &gt; Global Options, unclick “Restore .RData into Workspace at Startup” and choosing Never on the “Save workspace to .RData on exit”.",

Each .Rmd starts with a header, where you can change the name and the date.\nA .Rmd is made up of two main components: code chunks (this is where you write code) and text (any words that are outside of a code chunk). Any time you are writing code, it needs to be in a code chunk. Chunks can then be run to execute the code within the chunk. The idea of chunking is to group code that accomplishes a single, related task into one code chunk. When you begin a new step or process in your workflow, you start a new chunk.\nYour .Rmd template already has a header (where you can change the name and date) and two code chunks. The first code chunk is the SET UP CHUNK. The second code chunk is the LIBRARY AND DATA CHUNK. To load the libraries and data, you should RUN CODE CHUNK.\n\nIf everything is working, ‘parks’ should appear in your environment. The ‘parks’ dataset is now an “object”.\nWe can view objects by double clicking the object in the environment. A data table should appear with all the information about the parks.\n\nAdd a new code chunk and add the code below to create your first map. Every command that you create should have a comment (#) above that explains what that command is doing. If you run that chunk, a map should appear below.",

    "text": "6.1 Orienting Ourselves to the Datasets\nIn this chapter, we will apply what we know about describing data to explore three datasets. Descriptive statistics are a set of tools that allow us to summarize a given dataset based on various characteristics.\nWe will use the following spatial data:\nThe last two datasets are aggregated summaries rather than raw measurements. The Climate Normals are temporal averages,meaning that the data represent the average conditions over a 30-year period. The ACS data are spatial averages, which summarize individual responses within defined geographic areas. This is a requirement for many spatial datasets, even when individual-level data is available, to maintain anonymity.\nAs a result, when we analyze these datasets, we are working with information that has already been statistically summarized over time and space, and our own statistical descriptions will be second-order summaries that describe patterns in data that have already been aggregated.\nTo follow along with this tutorial, download the .Rmd template here. The template already includes a code chunk for loading libraries and reading in the data, along with labeled empty chunks for each section of the tutorial. As you work through the code examples below, add each set of commands to the chunk with the matching section heading in your template.\nThe ‘glimpse()’ function provides a quick overview of the structure and contents of a dataset. It displays the data types of each column and a preview of the data, making it easier to understand the dataset at a glance.\n## glimpse at the rurality data\nglimpse(rurality)\n\nRows: 2,672\nColumns: 4\n$ GEOID           &lt;chr&gt;

Spatial data is often aggregated to specific geographic units (for instance, to protect individual privacy or simplify a complex dataset). This aggregation influences the descriptive statistics we calculate.\nIn this lab, you will examine demographic and climate data at a different level of spatial aggregation and observe how the descriptive statistics change as a result (remember the underlying data values are not changing, only the geographic units used to summarize them). You will also explore an alternative way of defining “rural” and compare how this definition shapes your interpretation of the data.\nRemember that you can use the Command Compendium to help you modify R commands",

    "text": "8.1.1 Overview\nIn the Describing Data tutorial we worked with spatial datasets describing the rurality of North Carolina census tracts, summer temperatures across the United States, and a demographic variable measured at the census tract level in North Carolina. Spatial data is often aggregated to specific geographic units (for instance, to protect individual privacy or simplify a complex dataset). This aggregation influences the descriptive statistics we calculate.\nIn this lab, you will examine demographic and climate data at a different level of spatial aggregation and observe how the descriptive statistics change as a result (remember the underlying data values are not changing, only the geographic units used to summarize them). You will also explore an alternative way of defining “rural” and compare how this definition shapes your interpretation of the data.\nRemember that you can use the Command Compendium to help you modify R commands\n\n\n8.1.2 Specifications\nThis lab is designed to assess the Concept 3 Competencies. You’ll be evaluated on the following specifications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nHTML and RMD versions the R Markdown file have been submitted.\n\n\nThe RMD is clearly organized (appropriate headings, code chunk formatting, and clean output) so that the analysis is easy to read and understand.\n\n\nDescribing Rurality: Analysis demonstrates competency through correct descriptive statistics, appropriate visualizations, a map, and an accurate written interpretation\n\n\nDescribing Climate: Analysis demonstrates competency through correct descriptive statistics, appropriate visualizations, a map, and an accurate written interpretation\n\n\nDescribing Demographics: Analysis demonstrates competency through correct descriptive statistics, appropriate visualizations, a map, and an accurate written interpretation\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Lab Instructions\n\nCreate a new .Rmd named “LASTNAME_lab3.Rmd”.

In this section you will compute descriptive statistics and visualizations for North Carolina census tracts using the North Carolina Rural Center’s definition of rurality (rural = fewer than 250 people per square mile). The NC Rural Center variable is named nc_rural_center in the dataset. Add a code chunk below your header. Your code chunk should:\n\nCreate a descriptive statistics table of rurality by census tract\nCreate a bar chart of rurality by census tract\nCreate a map of rurality by census tract\n\nBelow your chunk, you should write 1-2 paragraphs that do the following:\n\nDescribe what the bar chart and descriptive statistics tell us about the data\nDescribe what the map tells us about the spatial pattern of the data\nCompare the NC Rural Center definition of rural with the USDA RUCA codes, describing how the descriptive statistics differ and how the spatial patterns differ across the state\n\nAdd “Describing Climate” as a third-level header.

Create one data visualization to compliment the statistics table.\n\n\n7.1.2 Spatial Descriptive Statistics\n\n7.1.2.1 Mean Center\nThe mean center of a spatial dataset represents the average location of a set of points and is calculated by taking the average of all the x-coordinates and all the y-coordinates in the dataset.\n\n#calculate mean center of all tornados in dataset\ntorn_mean_center &lt;- center_mean(torn)\n\n#map tornadoes and mean center\ntm_shape(torn) + tm_dots() + tm_shape(torn_mean_center) + tm_dots(fill = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ4. What does the location of our mean center tell us about the spatial distribution of tornadoes in the United States?\n\n\n7.1.2.2 Weighted Mean Center\nThe weighted mean center calculates the average location, but allows you to select a variable to weight by. The calculation then gives more influence to features with larger values of that variable. For instance, we could give higher weight to fatal tornadoes\n\n## calculate weighted mean center using \"fat\" variable\ntorn_w_mean_center &lt;- center_mean(torn, weight = torn$fat)\n\n\n##map mean center and weighted mean center\ntm_shape(torn) + tm_dots() + tm_shape(torn_mean_center) + tm_dots(fill = \"blue\") + tm_shape(torn_w_mean_center) + tm_dots(fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ5. What does the difference between the mean center and the weighted mean center (weighted by fatalities) tell us about the spatial distribution of fatal tornadoes?\nQ6. Using the code below, calculate and map the difference in the weighted mean center for tornadoes before 2000 and after 2000. What does this tell us about how the spatial pattern of tornadoes has changed over time?\n\n#tornadoes before 2000\ntorn_b_2000 &lt;- torn |&gt; filter(yr &lt; 2000)\n\n#tornados after 2000\ntorn_a_2000 &lt;- torn |&gt; filter(yr &gt;= 2000)\n\n\n\n7.1.2.3 Standard Deviational Ellipse\nThe standard deviational ellipse is a method for summarizing the spatial central tendency, dispersion, and directional trends. The ellipse visually represents the spread of the data and the direction of the spread. It is centered on the mean center and its axes represent the standard deviation of the x and y coordinates.\n\n#calculate standard ellipse values\nstd_ellip_torn &lt;- std_dev_ellipse(torn)\n\n#create an ellipse of those values\nstd_ellip_torn &lt;- sfdep::st_ellipse(geometry =std_ellip_torn,\n                                   sx = std_ellip_torn$sx,\n                                   sy = std_ellip_torn$sy,\n                                   rotation = -std_ellip_torn$theta)\n#map the ellipse with transparency\ntm_shape(torn) + tm_dots() + tm_shape(std_ellip_torn) + tm_polygons(fill_alpha = .5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ6.
